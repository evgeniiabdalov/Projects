	ContinousRec (MAPF-R visualization tool) manual:
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Main toolbar inscludes such interface elements as:
	• the main menu panel
	• the uploaded solutions list
	• the visualization screen
	• the vizualization control panel

	In File menu user could:
	• upload new solution
	• start visualization process
	• check solution parameters
	• clear the visualization screen

	------------------New solution-----------------------------

	New solution button opens window for setting up input files. There are three
	types of files that has to be uploaded.

	Load agents button opens file dialogue to set up file with agents pa-
	rameters. Load graph button opens file dialogue to set up file with graph
	parameters. Load plans button opens file dialogue to set up file with agents
	plans. In text field user should input solution name. SUBMIT button initiates
	uploading data from files and creating new solution. This new solution then
	appears in the uploaded solutions list(left side of main window).

	------------------Start visualization-----------------------------

	In order to visualize solution on the screen user should choose one in the
	uploaded solutions list, then click on button Start visualization, which
	launches visualization.

	------------------Solution parameters-----------------------------

	Solution parameters button opens an information window, with such solu-
	tion parameters as an amount of vertices, an amount of edges, a list of agents,
	etc.. In order to open agent parameters(agent identification, start location,
	target location, etc), user should choose an agent from the list and then
	double-click it, as a result the agent’s parameters will be shown in the right
	section of the window.

	------------------Clear visualization-----------------------------

	Clear visualization button removes a visualized solution from the screen.

	------------------The visualization screen-----------------------------

	Graph and agent objects are displayed on the visualization screen.

	------------------Zooming-----------------------------

	In order to zoom in or zoom out user should put a cursor on the graph and
	scroll in or scroll out respectively.Zooming in and zooming out is activated by
	touchpad.

	------------------Marking agents-----------------------------

	In order to mark an agent, user should click on it. In order to unmark it user
	should click on it again. By default marked agent color is not set up, so user
	should set it up manually in Color settings.

	------------------View-----------------------------

	In the view menu user could:
	• open the single agent statistics window
	• open the double agent statistics window
	• open the color settings window
	• manipulate visibility settings

	------------------Single agent statistics-----------------------------

	Single agent statistics button opens window with single agent statistics
	interface.

	------------------Double agent statistics-----------------------------

	Double agent statistics button opens window with double agent statistics
	interface.

	------------------Change color-----------------------------

	Change color button opens a window with color settings interface. The win-
	dow has several color palettes: moving agent, waiting agent, initialized agent,
	arrived agent, marked agent, vertex. First yser has to define all this color
	palletes. Afterwards SUBMIT COLOR button applies color settings.

	------------------Graph visible-----------------------------

	Graph visible button changes graph visibility settings. If the graph is visible,
	it will be invisible, otherwise it returns to its initial visible state.

	------------------Agent visible-----------------------------

	Agent visible button changes visibility of agents. It makes not marked
	agents invisible and it leaves marked agents visible on the screen.
	To return all agents back to its visibility, user should click Agent visible button
	again.

	------------------PhotoVideoOutput-----------------------------

	PhotoVideoOutput menu button contains buttons that are responsible for
	multimedia output.

	------------------Take snapshot-----------------------------

	Take snapshot button creates photos of visualization screen and of single/-
	double statistics screen, if they are opened at the moment.

	------------------Start video/Stop video-----------------------------

	In order to begin video capture user should activate Start video button.
	Video captures everything that happens on the screen. Stop video stops
	video capture.

	------------------VideoSettings-----------------------------

	In order to set resolution of video recording user should activate Video settings
	button. Then input height and width parameters of video recording. Pay at-
	tention, that you should input value, which is one point lesser than monitor
	parameter. For instance, if your monitor resolution is 1366*768, you should
	input width:1365, height:767

	------------------The visualization control panel-----------------------------

	The visualization control panel is an interface that manipulates the visual-
	ization process. play button starts an animation, pause button pauses the
	animation, stop button stops the animation. When the animation is being
	played, timer appears on top of the screen and starts running. >>> and <<<
	buttons change direction of the animation, forwards and backwards respec-
	tively. To adjust speed user could use speed up or slow down buttons.
	Among the visualization controllers there are two sliders. The top slider
	controls a timeline position. By using the timeline slider user could 
	adjust time of the animation. The down slider controls a rotation state. User
	could use the rotation slider to adjust an angle of the visualization screen.


	------------------The single agent statistics window overview-----------------------------

	The single agent statistics window showcases statistical data, that are related
	to the one single agent. First user should input an agent index, statistical
	data will be shown specifically for the agent with inserted index.

	The time ratio chart displays data, that are linked to the agent states:
	MOVING, WAITING, INTIALIZING, ARRIVED.

	Time ratio mode menu button has two options, total time ratio and
	agent time ratio. total time ratio activates the bar chart with the total
	time ratio data. agent time ratio activates the bar chart with the time ratio
	data, that are relevant for the chosen agent. It is possible to display the total
	time ratio and the single agent time ratio at the same time, which is useful
	for a comparison analysis.

	Data mode menu button has two options: Speed mode and Location mode.
	Speed mode is a function that displays agent speed value at the current time
	of movement. Speed mode is a function that displays agent location value at
	the current time of movement.

	Chart mode menu button sets up how data is going to be displayed.
	Real-time mode starts displaying as animation starts playing. Data updates
	every second, therefore it is recommended to slow down animation speed.
	Not real time mode displays data independently on animation playing. To
	set frequency rate in the precision text field user should insert the period
	of milliseconds. The minimum value is 60, since the animation is displayed in Java FX standard 60 fps,
	the maximum value is the total duration of the animation.

	------------------The double agent statistics window overview-----------------------------

	The double agent statistics window showcases statistical comparison data be-
	tween two agents. User should insert two indexes, each one corresponds to its
	relative agent.

	Chart mode button menu button sets up how data is going to be displayed.
	It has the same options as Chart mode button in the single agent statistics
	interface.

	Data mode menu button has two options. Distance mode is a function
	that displays the distance between two agents at the current time of movement.
	Collision risk mode is a function that displays the rate of collision risk
	between two agents at the current time of movement.

	Collisions are displayed in Collision list. In this list agents involved
	in collision event are presented as well as time of collision event. User should
	click on the collision event list item and click button Set collision event.
	Afterwards on the visualization screen there are only selected agents left. To
	make all agents visible again, user should click agents visible button.

	-------------------The group agent statistics window overview------------------------------

	The group agent statistics window showcases statistical comparison data be-
	tween a group of agents. User should insert mark agents on the main window,
	then by clicking set group agents button the group is set - agent indexes
	appear in the list.

	Similar to previous statistics windows Data mode menu button has two op-
	tions: Distance mode and Collision risk mode. Distance mode displays
	average distance value within the group of agents, meanwhile Collision risk mode
	displays average risk collision between agents in the group.
