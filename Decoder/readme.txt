The main goal of this application is to decode messages on the basis of given dictionary.
In order to calculate all decoding variations recursive algorithm is implemented.

Here is an example of application work:

Dictionary:
  a
  brown
  dog
  fox
  jumps
  lazy
  over
  quick
  the
  unambiguous
  
Coded messages:
  
  jlxkzmvjpjb ghi qjmsu zrpwl fpt ojkyb pdir x exac npv
  unambiguous the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog
