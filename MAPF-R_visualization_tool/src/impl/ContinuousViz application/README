ContinuousViz application is a MAPF-R visualization tool.
Its main is to visualize solution to MAPF-R problem and
facilitate detection of possible redundancies of the solution.
It was made by Evgenii Abdalov as a part of the thesis work 

Visual Analysis of Plans for Multi-Agent Path Finding with Continuous Time (MAPF-R)

supervised by doc. RNDr. Pavel Surynek, Ph.D.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

The whole source code and libraries are placed in folder 'MAPF-R.visualization.tool'.

'MAPF-R.visualization.tool.jar' is an executable binary file,
to execute it you have to start script 'run', 
to disable Hardware Graphics Acceleration(Prism) of JavaFX you have to start script 'run2'. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test input data is placed in folder './MAPF-R.visualization.tool/Test data'

Functioning solution are placed in folder './MAPF-R.visualization.tool/Test data/Solutions'

Some type of incorrect input is presented in following folders:

'./MAPF-R.visualization.tool/Test data/Incorrect agents'

'./MAPF-R.visualization.tool/Test data/Incorrect graph'

'./MAPF-R.visualization.tool/Test data/Incorrect plans'
